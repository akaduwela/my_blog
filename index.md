# Wearable Continuous Blood Pressure Monitor

# Project Summary

Our goal is to design a wrist-band with attachments that can successfully monitor userâ€™s blood pressure using single or dual-point photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms without a constant heart reference.

## Method

### Hardware: Sensor and Embedded Platform

Using a PPG sensor, ADC, and Raspberry Pi we can obtain real time PPG waveforms, which will be used to predict the BP of the user. For the verification of our system, we will only be able to use discrete BP measurements using an air-pressure based BP cuff.
